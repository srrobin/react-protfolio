                    I am a self 👩‍💻taught creative front-end developer and web designer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh . I especially like to work on the front end of software. As a front-end developer and web designer, helping startups gain their unfair advantage. Although I majored in math, I love coding. When I'm not developing or designing, I enjoy studying or traveling around the various rural areas of Bangladesh.
