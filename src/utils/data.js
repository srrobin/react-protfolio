    desc: 'THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC) CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE BUSINESSES AND IT DEPARTMENTS CAN COLLABORATE TO PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY SOFTWARE. THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO PLANNING, DESIGNING, TESTING, AND DEPLOYING SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAKES SDLC AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF SUCCESSFUL SOFTWARE PROJECTS. THE SDLC EVOLVES WITH TECHNOLOGY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE‚ÄôLL LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE IN 2024 AND CONSIDER HOW ITS PRINCIPLES CAN BE USED TO CREATE MORE EFFICIENT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC) IS A SET OF STAGES, ACTIVITIES, AND TASKS THAT SOFTWARE PROJECTS GO THROUGH. THE PROCESS OUTLINES HOW SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS BUILD, TEST, DEPLOY, AND MAINTAIN THEIR SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE TOP QUALITY ON TIME AND WITHIN BUDGET. SDLC BEGINS WITH THE PLANNING PHASE, WHERE THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM DEFINES AND ANALYZES THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS, GOALS, AND TIMELINE. AFTER THE PLANNING PHASE, THE TEAM CREATES THE PROTOTYPE BY DESIGNING, BUILDING, AND INTEGRATING DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. NEXT, THE DEVELOPERS EVALUATE THE PROJECT, INVESTIGATE ANY REPORTED ISSUES, AND FIX BUGS TO ENSURE THE SOFTWARE WORKS EFFICIENTLY BEFORE THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH. WHILE THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE A QUALITY AND TIMELY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, THE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE ALSO INVOLVES ROUTINE MAINTENANCE TO ENSURE THE SOFTWARE REMAINS RUNNING WITHOUT HITCHES. WHEN IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY, THESE CORE SDLC ACTIVITIES PROVIDE SEVERAL BENEFITS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS WILL DIVE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE IMPORTANCE OF SDLC TO BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT TEAMS.',
